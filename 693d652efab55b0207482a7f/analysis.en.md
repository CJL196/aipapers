## 1.5. Abstract
This study investigates the effectiveness of using a virtual reality (VR) public speaking training simulation as an instructional tool in a basic communication course. It comprises two distinct studies. The first study indicated that `VR practice` was associated with higher subsequent `speech delivery grades` compared to students who did not practice. However, `VR practice` did not lead to a reduction in `public speaking anxiety (PSA)`. The second, follow-up study compared `VR practice` with other `lab-based practice` methods, including practicing in front of a mirror and a recorded video session. The results showed that all forms of `lab practice` (VR, mirror, or video) were linked to higher `speech grades` than no practice at all, but there were no significant differences in outcomes among the different `lab-practice conditions`. The paper concludes with a discussion on the implications of adopting and utilizing `virtual public-speaking simulations` in large undergraduate public speaking courses.

# 2. Executive Summary

## 2.1. Background & Motivation
The core problem the paper aims to address is the challenge of effectively teaching public speaking skills and reducing `public speaking anxiety (PSA)` in large `basic communication courses`. These courses are often a cornerstone of communication departments in higher education, with a primary goal of improving students' `communication competence`, especially in public speaking.

The problem is important because `public speaking` is a fundamental skill, but existing course structures, such as `overcrowding` and potential `lack of standardized feedback`, can hinder opportunities for meaningful practice and feedback. Traditional methods rely on behavioral training, practice, and performance feedback, but scaling these effectively for large classes is difficult.

The paper's innovative idea or entry point is to explore `virtual reality (VR)` public speaking simulations as a potential solution. `VR` offers a way to efficiently incorporate controlled practice sessions with `virtual audiences` that can provide `life-like and synchronous feedback`, potentially overcoming some of the limitations of traditional classroom settings. The central research question is to what extent `VR public speaking` can simulate, complement, or enhance effective speech practice in a `basic communication course`.

## 2.2. Main Contributions / Findings
The paper makes several primary contributions through its two studies:

*   **VR Practice Improves Speech Grades:** Both studies consistently found that students who engaged in `lab practice` (including `VR practice` in Study 1, and `VR`, `mirror`, or `video` practice in Study 2) achieved higher `speech grades` compared to those who did not practice. This reinforces the importance of practice for public speaking competence.
*   **VR is Not Superior to Other Lab Practice Methods for Grades:** Study 2 specifically compared `VR practice` with `mirror practice` and `video-recorded practice`. The results indicated that while all `lab practice` methods improved grades over no practice, `VR` did not offer a unique advantage over these more traditional and often cheaper alternatives in terms of `speech grades`.
*   **No Significant Reduction in Public Speaking Anxiety (PSA) or Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE) from VR:** Contrary to some prior research, neither study found that `VR practice` significantly reduced `PSA` or `FNE`.
*   **VR Perceived as More Demanding:** Study 2 found that participants perceived `speech delivery` and `rehearsal` in `VR` as more `demanding` than in the `mirror` or `video conditions`. This finding supports the `Computers as Social Actors (CASA)` paradigm, suggesting that `VR` can effectively simulate `real-world public speaking` demands.
*   **Engagement and Novelty Factor:** The authors noted that students generally `enjoyed` the `VR sessions`, found `value` in them, and were `eager to participate` due to the novelty of the technology. This suggests `VR` could be a valuable tool for `motivating students` to practice, which is crucial for skill improvement.

    These findings solve the problem of determining whether `VR` is a uniquely effective tool for public speaking training in a `basic communication course` and contextualize its utility alongside other `lab-based practice` methods. The results indicate that while `VR` is beneficial, its unique advantages over more accessible practice methods might be limited for `speech grade` improvement within a single session.

# 3. Prerequisite Knowledge & Related Work

## 3.1. Foundational Concepts

To fully understand this paper, a beginner should be familiar with the following core concepts:

*   **Public Speaking Anxiety (PSA):** This refers specifically to the fear or anxiety associated with delivering a speech in front of an audience. It's a common form of performance anxiety. The paper uses the `Personal Report of Public Speaking Anxiety (PRPSA)` scale to measure this.
*   **Communication Apprehension (CA):** A broader term than `PSA`, `CA` is an individual's fear or anxiety associated with either real or anticipated communication with another person or persons. `PSA` can be considered a specific manifestation of `CA`.
*   **Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE):** This is the apprehension about others' evaluations, distress over possible negative evaluations, and an expectation that one would be evaluated negatively. `FNE` is closely related to `CA` and `PSA` and is often an underlying cause of public speaking fears. The paper uses the `Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (FNES)` to measure this.
*   **Virtual Reality (VR):** A simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. `VR` typically involves a `headset` that provides a `3D virtual environment`, immersing the user and often allowing for interaction within that environment. In this context, it simulates a public speaking scenario with a `virtual audience`.
*   **Computers as Social Actors (CASA) Paradigm:** A theory proposed by Reeves & Nass (1996) suggesting that people tend to respond to `computers` and `other media` as if they were human, often applying social rules and expectations to their interactions with technology. In this paper, `CASA` is used to explain why `virtual audiences` might induce realistic social responses and anxiety in speakers.
*   **Quasi-Experimental Design:** A research design that resembles a true experiment but lacks the random assignment of participants to intervention or control groups. In Study 1, participants `opted` into `VR practice` rather than being randomly assigned, making it `quasi-experimental`. This design can introduce `selection effects` where pre-existing differences between groups might influence outcomes.
*   **Random Assignment:** A procedure used in true experimental designs where participants are randomly allocated to different experimental conditions (e.g., `VR`, `mirror`, `video`, `no practice`). This helps ensure that the groups are comparable at the outset, minimizing the influence of confounding variables and allowing for stronger causal inferences. Study 2 used `random assignment`.
*   **Hierarchical Regression:** A statistical technique used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and a set of independent variables, where independent variables are entered into the regression model in multiple steps or blocks. This allows researchers to examine the unique contribution of each block of variables to the prediction of the dependent variable, controlling for variables entered in previous steps.
*   **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** A statistical test used to compare the means of three or more groups to determine if there are any statistically significant differences between them. A `one-way ANOVA` is used when comparing means across different levels of a single independent variable (e.g., comparing `speech grades` across `VR`, `mirror`, `video`, and `no lab practice` conditions).
*   **MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance):** An extension of `ANOVA` that is used when there are two or more dependent variables and one or more independent variables. It tests whether there are statistically significant differences between the means of two or more groups on a combination of dependent variables.
*   **t-test:** A statistical hypothesis test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. It is often used to compare a treatment group to a control group or to compare two different treatment groups.
*   **Effect Size ($\eta^2$, Cohen's $d$):** Measures that quantify the strength of a relationship or the magnitude of a difference between groups, independent of sample size.
    *   $\eta^2$ (eta-squared): Used in `ANOVA`, it represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable.
    *   Cohen's $d$: Used in `t-tests`, it measures the standardized difference between two means, indicating the practical significance of the difference.

## 3.2. Previous Works

The paper builds upon a rich body of literature in communication pedagogy, public speaking training, and `virtual reality` applications.

*   **Importance of Public Speaking and Basic Courses:**
    *   Cohen (1994) and Morreale et al. (2016) highlight `public speaking` as the `cornerstone` of communication departments and `basic communication courses` as crucial for improving `communication competence`. Morreale et al. (2007) outline eight key competencies for effective public speaking, emphasizing skills like choosing topics, providing supporting material, organization, language, vocal variety, articulation, and `nonverbal behaviors`.
*   **Role of Practice and Feedback:**
    *   Pearson et al. (2006) showed that `preparation and practice` prior to delivery lead to better assessments. The `amount` (Menzel & Carrell, 1994) and `type` of practice (Farris et al., 2013; Pearson et al., 2008; Smith & Frymier, 2006) are identified as important influences. Lucas (2015) in `The Art of Public Speaking` emphasizes practice as essential.
    *   `Targeted feedback` is also critical. Book (1985) argues for `immediate feedback` for speaker improvement. Bourhis and Allen (1998) meta-analysis suggests `videotaped feedback` improves skill acquisition, content, recall, and course attitudes.
*   **Addressing Public Speaking Anxiety (PSA) and Communication Apprehension (CA):**
    *   Allen & Bourhis (1996), Allen et al. (1989), Bodie (2010), McCroskey (1982), and Robinson (1997) emphasize the need to overcome `PSA` and `CA`, which negatively impact public speaking. Practice is noted as one of the most effective techniques to reduce `CA` (Allen et al., 1989; Bodie, 2010). `Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE)` (Watson & Friend, 1969) is identified as a closely related underlying cause.
*   **Virtual Reality for Public Speaking:**
    *   Early research, including Harris et al. (2002), Pertaub et al. (2002), and Vanni et al. (2013), focused on `VR`'s efficacy for `exposure therapy` to desensitize highly reactive speakers, often showing `VR` can induce anxiety (Kothgassner et al., 2016; Pertaub et al., 2002; Slater et al., 2006) and reduce `PSA` when combined with therapy.
    *   More recent work has explored `VR` as a pedagogical aid:
        *   LeFebvre et al. (2020) found `VR practice` decreased anxiety in imagined interactions.
        *   Davis et al. (2020) showed `VR practice` *increased* speech anxiety, highlighting mixed results.
        *   Frisby et al. (2020) found `VR` enhanced `public speaking self-efficacy perceptions`.
        *   Vallade et al. (2020) reported `VR` leading to positive emotional experiences and explored `technology acceptance`.
        *   Chollet et al. (2015) investigated `in-platform feedback` from `virtual audiences`, noting interactive feedback was engaging.
        *   Batrinca et al. (2013) mentioned `VR` software collecting behavioral data (eye gaze, vocalics) for feedback.
*   **Comparison to Other Practice Methods:**
    *   Dermody & Sutherland (2019) discuss `mirror practice` as a traditional method to induce `self-awareness`. The paper also implicitly compares `VR` to `video recording`, a technique extensively studied for its feedback benefits (Bourhis & Allen, 1998).

## 3.3. Technological Evolution

The evolution of public speaking training has moved from purely in-person, instructor-led feedback and peer practice, to incorporating technological aids, and now towards immersive `virtual reality` solutions.

1.  **Traditional Methods (Pre-20th Century):** Focused on rhetorical training, memorization, and live practice with feedback from instructors or peers.
2.  **Audio/Video Recording (Mid-20th Century onwards):** The advent of recording technology (audio tapes, then videotapes) allowed speakers to review their own performances, providing a form of objective self-feedback. This was a significant step, as highlighted by Bourhis and Allen (1998).
3.  **Mirror Practice (Long-standing, but formalized):** Practicing in front of a mirror provides immediate `visual feedback` and fosters `self-awareness`, a technique discussed by Dermody & Sutherland (2019).
4.  **Early Virtual Reality (Late 20th/Early 21st Century):** Initial `VR` applications for `public speaking` primarily focused on `exposure therapy` for severe `PSA` (Harris et al., 2002; Pertaub et al., 2002; Vanni et al., 2013). These systems aimed to desensitize individuals by gradually exposing them to simulated speaking situations.
5.  **Modern VR Simulations (2010s onwards):** With advancements in `VR hardware` (e.g., `HTC VIVE`) and `software` (e.g., `Virtual Orator`), `VR` became more accessible and capable of creating realistic, interactive `virtual audiences`. These systems began incorporating `in-platform feedback` on `eye gaze`, `vocalics`, and `nonverbal cues` (Batrinca et al., 2013; Chollet et al., 2015), moving beyond mere exposure to pedagogical tools.

    This paper's work fits within the timeline at the stage of evaluating `modern VR simulations` as a practical instructional aid within standard `basic communication courses`, directly comparing their efficacy against established methods like `mirror` and `video practice`.

## 3.4. Differentiation Analysis

Compared to the main methods in related work, this paper's approach offers several core differences and innovations:

*   **Integration into an Existing Course:** Unlike many `VR` studies that are standalone experiments or therapeutic interventions, this research integrates `VR training` directly into a `large introductory public speaking course`. This provides a realistic context for evaluating `VR`'s practical utility as a pedagogical tool rather than just a research curiosity.
*   **Focus on Speech Grades as a Primary Outcome:** While much previous `VR` research focused on `anxiety reduction` or `self-efficacy`, this paper specifically uses actual `speech grades` as a key dependent variable. This offers a tangible, quantifiable measure of `competence improvement` that is highly relevant to educators.
*   **Direct Comparison to Multiple Lab Practice Methods:** Study 2 is a significant innovation by `randomly assigning` participants to `VR`, `mirror`, or `video practice` conditions, in addition to a `no practice` control. This allows for a direct, controlled comparison of `VR` against more accessible and traditional `lab-based practice` methods, providing practical insights into `VR`'s unique value (or lack thereof).
*   **Investigation of Potential Mechanisms:** The paper attempts to explore *why* `VR` might (or might not) be effective by measuring potential mediating variables such as `task interest`, `enjoyment`, `spatial presence`, `task difficulty`, `demand perceptions`, `self-awareness`, and `self-esteem`. This moves beyond simply observing effects to understanding the underlying psychological processes.
*   **Addressing Selection Bias:** Study 2's `random assignment` explicitly addresses a limitation of Study 1's `quasi-experimental design`, where `self-selection` into `VR practice` could have confounded results. This strengthens the causal inferences drawn from the second study.

    In essence, while previous work established `VR`'s potential for `exposure therapy` and explored its general pedagogical utility, this paper rigorously evaluates `VR`'s effectiveness in a real-world educational setting, directly comparing it to common alternatives, and focusing on a critical educational outcome (`speech grades`), while also probing potential explanatory mechanisms.

# 4. Methodology

## 4.1. Principles
The core idea behind this methodology is to pragmatically assess the utility of `Virtual Reality (VR)` as an instructional aid for public speaking within the context of a large, existing undergraduate communication course. The theoretical basis stems from the well-established understanding that `practice`, `feedback`, and `anxiety reduction` are crucial for developing effective `public speaking skills`. `VR` is hypothesized to enhance these elements by providing systematic practice opportunities with a `virtual audience`, delivering `in-platform feedback`, and potentially reducing `public speaking anxiety (PSA)`. The intuition is that a simulated, yet realistic, environment can bridge the gap between classroom instruction and actual performance, allowing students to rehearse and refine their skills in a low-stakes setting.

## 4.2. Core Methodology In-depth (Layer by Layer)

The research consists of two studies, each building upon the previous one to address specific questions and limitations.

### 4.2.1. Study 1 Methodology

**Participants:**
*   **Recruitment:** Students were recruited from a `large introductory communication class`.
*   **Sample Size:** Initial recruitment included $n=204$ students (45% female; $M_{age} = 19.52$, $SD_{age} = 1.37$).
*   **Retention for Analysis:** Only participants ($n=140$) who agreed to have all their course grades used for the research were retained for analysis.
*   **Compensation:** Students received `course credit` for involvement and could complete an alternative assignment if preferred.
*   **Ethical Approval:** All procedures were approved by the `university Institutional Review Board`.

**Procedure:**
Study 1 used a `quasi-experimental method` to minimize disruption to the existing class structure.
1.  **Initial Survey (T1):** Two weeks before the first speech of the semester, participants completed a survey measuring their `PSA`, `interest in VR`, `experience with VR`, and `demographic information`.
2.  **VR Practice Session:** After the initial survey but before delivering their final speech, 80 participants `opted` to practice their speech in `VR`. This self-selection is a key aspect of the `quasi-experimental` design.
3.  **Lab Visit:** Upon arrival at the lab, participants were provided with a `consent form` and a brief description of the experimental procedure.
4.  **VR Practice:** Students then practiced their speech in the `VR` environment.
5.  **Post-Practice Measures (T2):** Afterward, participants completed measures on `simulation sickness`, `interest in the practice session`, `spatial presence`, `PSA`, and `FNE`.
6.  **Feedback Review:** Participants received feedback from the `virtual program` and could review it for as long as they wished.
7.  **Final Speech Delivery:** No more than 3 weeks after `VR practice`, students delivered the same speech they had practiced for their `recitation section` (a smaller 10-20 person subgroup of the larger class).
8.  **Grade Assessment:** `Speech grades` were assessed by `trained graduate teaching assistants` and compiled at the end of the semester.

**Software:**
*   **VirtualOrator (Blom, 2018):** This software package was used for the `VR training sessions`.
*   **Scenario:** All participants used the `same small classroom scenario` for their presentation.
*   **Audience Configuration:** The `virtual audience` was set to be `friendly` and `equally distributed` in terms of gender and race.
*   **Practice Duration:** Participants were given `12 minutes` to practice.
*   **Data Recording:** `VirtualOrator` recorded `speaker performance` through the computer's `internal webcam` (with an insert of the speaker's field of vision in `VR`) and collected data on `verbal and nonverbal performance` (e.g., `speech pitch`, `volume`, `gaze distribution`).

**Hardware:**
*   **Computer:** `Alienware 15R4 laptop computer`.
*   **VR Headset:** `HTC VIVE headset` (with accompanying software).
*   **VR Platform:** The virtual environment ran through `SteamVR` (Valve, 2019).
*   **Navigation:** Participants used the `VIVE controller` to change slides or access notes by clicking directional arrow buttons.

**Measures (Study 1):**

1.  **Personal Report of Public Speaking Anxiety (PRPSA):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** This scale measures the level of anxiety individuals experience when anticipating or engaging in public speaking. It assesses general fears and apprehension related to oral communication.
    *   **Details:** A 34-item scale (McCroskey, 1970).
    *   **Measurements:** Collected at recruitment (`T1`: $n=132$, $\alpha=.90$, $M=3.28$, $SD=0.53$) and again after participants gave the speech in `VR` (`T2`: $n=53$, $\alpha=.92$, $M=3.26$, $SD=0.63$). Higher scores indicate more `public speaking anxiety`.

2.  **Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (FNES):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** This scale measures an individual's apprehension about receiving negative evaluations from others, distress over possible negative evaluations, and the expectation of being evaluated negatively.
    *   **Details:** A scale developed by Leary (1983) (number of items not specified in abstract, but context implies a standard version).
    *   **Measurements:** Measured after recruitment (`T1`: $n=132$, $\alpha=.90$, $M=3.21$, $SD=0.76$) and after giving the speech in `VR` (`T2`: $n=54$, $\alpha=.92$, $M=3.23$, $SD=0.79$). Higher scores indicate greater `fear of negative evaluation`.

3.  **VR Feedback:**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** This refers to objective data collected by the `VirtualOrator` software about the speaker's performance within the `VR environment`, which is then presented back to the speaker.
    *   **Details:** Includes `time looking at various quadrants of the virtual classroom`, `number of monotone segments`, `percent speaking in the same pitch, range, and volume of speech`.
    *   **Measurements:** Descriptive statistics for these measures are provided in Table 1.

4.  **Speech Grades:**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** The primary dependent variable, representing the formal assessment of student performance on a public speaking assignment.
    *   **Details:** The `final speech of the semester`, a 5-minute `special occasion speech` (e.g., toast, eulogy).
    *   **Measurements:** $n=140$, $Max=110$, $Min=74$, $M_{score}=100.37$, $SD_{score}=7.18$. Graded by `nine trained graduate instructors`. Scores were based on two major elements: `quality of a written outline` (content, references) and `quality of performance` (volume, rate, eye contact, posture, gestures).

**Additional Measures (Study 1):**

1.  **VR Experience (Hartmann et al., 2010):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** This scale assesses a participant's prior experience with `virtual environments`.
    *   **Details:** Five items measured on a 1-to-5 scale.
    *   **Measurements:** $n=132$, $M=2.90$, $SD=0.79$. Higher scores indicate more experience.

2.  **Task Evaluation (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory - IMI; Deci et al., 1994):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** Measures various aspects of participants' subjective experience and motivation related to the `VR practice task`.
    *   **Details:** Includes subscales for:
        *   `Interest/Enjoyment`: $\alpha=.82$, five items, $M=6.45$, $SD=1.23$.
        *   `Value/Usefulness`: $\alpha=.94$, six items, $M=6.51$, $SD=1.42$.
        *   `Effort/Importance`: $\alpha=.80$, six items, $M=5.50$, $SD=1.20$.
    *   **Measurements:** Measured on eight-point scales.

3.  **Spatial Presence (SPES; Hartmann et al., 2016):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** This scale assesses how realistic and immersive participants perceived the `virtual environment` to be.
    *   **Details:** Short form with four items, values ranging from 1 to 7.
    *   **Measurements:** $\alpha=.88$, $M=5.28$, $SD=1.08$.

### 4.2.2. Study 2 Methodology

**Participants:**
*   **Recruitment:** Students from the `same introductory communication course` in a `different semester`.
*   **Sample Size:** $n=371$ enrolled at T1, $n=234$ provided consent to release grades (51.3% female, $M_{age}=20.23$, $SD_{age}=1.20$).
*   **Exclusion:** None of the students in Study 2 participated in Study 1.
*   **Compensation/Ethical Approval:** Identical to Study 1.

**Procedure:**
Study 2 employed a `randomized controlled design` to address the `self-selection` limitation of Study 1.
1.  **Random Assignment:** Participants were `randomly assigned` to practice their speech in one of three lab conditions after arriving at the lab:
    *   **VR Condition:** Identical to Study 1.
    *   **Video Condition:** Used an `Alienware 15R4 laptop computer` to record the student practicing their speech. Participants saw themselves on-screen as they presented but were not required to watch the recording afterward.
    *   **Mirror Condition:** Used a `5-foot easel mirror` (following Dermody & Sutherland, 2019) for practice.
2.  **Self-Report Measures:** Only those who came to the lab completed the self-report measures.
3.  **Speech Grades:** Grades were collected similarly to Study 1, including for those who did not attend the speech lab, allowing for a `no lab practice` comparison group.

**Measures (Study 2):**

**Retained from Study 1:**
*   **Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (FNES):** $n=234$, $\alpha=.84$, $M=35.86$, $SD=8.39$.
*   **VR Experience (Hartmann et al., 2010):** $n=234$, $\alpha=.86$, $M=2.84$, $SD=0.91$.
*   **Task Evaluation (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory - IMI; Deci et al., 1994):**
    *   `Interest/Enjoyment`: $n=180$, $\alpha=.82$, $M=6.11$, $SD=1.66$.
    *   `Value/Usefulness`: $n=180$, $\alpha=.96$, $M=6.97$, $SD=1.84$.
    *   `Effort/Importance`: $n=180$, $\alpha=.81$, $M=5.76$, $SD=1.64$.
    *   *Note:* Measured on a `nine-point scale` in Study 2 (vs. eight-point in Study 1).
*   **Spatial Presence (SPES; Hartmann et al., 2016):**
    *   **Measurements:** $n=114$ (VR group only), $\alpha=.90$, $M=4.79$, $SD=1.23$.
*   **Speech Grades:** $n=371$, $M=93.02$, $SD=19.91$.

**New Measures for Study 2:**

1.  **Personal Report of Public Speaking Anxiety (PRPSA):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** Similar to Study 1, measuring `public speaking anxiety`, but using a shorter version to combat participant fatigue.
    *   **Details:** An 18-item version (Mörtberg et al., 2018).
    *   **Measurements:** `T1`: $n=242$, $\alpha=.93$, $M=48.76$, $SD=14.46$.

2.  **State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger et al., 1983):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** This scale measures both `state anxiety` (a temporary condition of anxiety or fear) and `trait anxiety` (a more stable characteristic of a person's personality). In this study, a 6-item version focused on state anxiety was likely used to capture immediate feelings.
    *   **Details:** A six-item version validated by Tluczek et al. (2009). Items include feelings calm, content, relaxed, tense (reverse), upset (reverse), and worried (reverse).
    *   **Scoring:** Responses on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Scored by taking the sum of all items (after reverse codes are corrected), multiplying by 20, and dividing by 6. Higher scores indicate `less anxiety`.
    *   **Measurements:** `T1`: $n=237$, $\alpha=.87$, $M=51.36$, $SD=13.44$. `T2`: $n=253$, $\alpha=.82$, $M=40.63$, $SD=12.09$.

3.  **Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE; Rosenberg, 1965):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** This scale measures `trait self-esteem`, an individual's overall sense of self-worth or personal value.
    *   **Details:** A 10-item scale.
    *   **Scoring:** Measures on a scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree). Scored by taking the sum of the items (after reverse codes are corrected).
    *   **Measurements:** `T1`: $n=234$, $\alpha=.90$, $M=35.44$, $SD=5.47$.

4.  **Self-Consciousness Scale (SCS-R; Scheier & Carver, 2013):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** This scale measures the extent to which individuals are generally aware of themselves and their behaviors, thoughts, and feelings. It includes public and private self-consciousness.
    *   **Details:** A 21-item scale, administered at `T1` only. Items ask participants to indicate the extent they feel nervous, anxious, and/or self-aware in social and private situations.
    *   **Scoring:** Measured on a scale from 1 (not like me at all) to 4 (a lot like me). The scale is the mean of all items. Higher scores indicate greater `self-consciousness`.
    *   **Measurements:** $n=236$, $\alpha=.84$, $M=2.63$, $SD=0.45$.

5.  **Personal Report of Confidence as a Speaker (MRPCS; Pertaub et al., 2001):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** A modified version focusing on somatic (physical) symptoms of anxiety experienced while speaking.
    *   **Details:** Eight items (e.g., "I felt discomfort in my stomach").
    *   **Scoring:** Measured on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Higher scores indicate `more fear while speaking`.
    *   **Measurements:** Measured for `VR condition` participants at `T2`: $n=259$, $\alpha=.87$, $M=1.50$, $SD=0.52$.

6.  **NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX; Hart & Staveland, 1988):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** A multidimensional scale designed to assess perceived `workload` on a task. It measures how demanding various elements of an experience are.
    *   **Details:** Contains 10 items.
    *   **Scoring:** Participants respond on a scale from 1 (very low) to 7 (very high). The scale was averaged across 10 items. Higher scores indicate `more task load`.
    *   **Measurements:** Repeated twice:
        *   `Speech Delivery Experience` (in the lab): $n=180$, $\alpha=.71$, $M=3.39$, $SD=1.00$.
        *   `Practicing Content` (remembering speech/topic): $n=180$, $\alpha=.73$, $M=3.33$, $SD=1.02$.

7.  **Cognitive Demand (Bowman et al., 2018):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** An adapted subscale to assess the extent to which the act of practicing the speech required `mental attention` and `intense thought`.
    *   **Details:** Seven items (e.g., "Practicing my speech made me draw on all my mental resources").
    *   **Scoring:** Measured on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The scale is the average of seven items. High scores indicate that practicing the speech required `more cognitive resources`.
    *   **Measurements:** $n=30$, $\alpha=.85$, $M=3.92$, $SD=1.08$.

# 5. Experimental Setup

## 5.1. Datasets
The datasets in this study consist of participant data collected from `undergraduate students` enrolled in a `large introductory communication course` at a Midwestern university.
*   **Study 1 Participants:** $n=140$ students (out of 204 recruited) who consented to grade release. Characteristics: 45% female; $M_{age} = 19.52$, $SD_{age} = 1.37$.
*   **Study 2 Participants:** $n=234$ students (out of 371 enrolled) who consented to grade release, from a different semester. Characteristics: 51.3% female; $M_{age} = 20.23$, $SD_{age} = 1.20$.
    The students represent a typical `college population` taking a `basic communication course`, making the findings relevant to similar educational contexts. The data includes self-report measures for various psychological constructs (`anxiety`, `self-esteem`, `motivation`, `VR experience`, `task load`) and objective measures such as `speech grades` and `VR performance metrics` (for the VR group).
These "datasets" are appropriate for validating the method's performance because the study is situated within the actual pedagogical context it aims to evaluate, using real student performance and self-perceptions.

## 5.2. Evaluation Metrics

The paper uses a combination of self-report psychological scales and objective performance measures.

1.  **Speech Grades:**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** The primary objective outcome measure, representing the overall quality of a student's public speaking performance, as assessed by trained instructors. It reflects both the content and delivery aspects of a speech.
    *   **Mathematical Formula:** Not a single formula, but typically a sum of scores from a rubric. The paper states scores were based on `quality of a written outline` (content, references) and `quality of performance` (volume, rate of speech, eye contact, posture, gestures).
    *   **Symbol Explanation:** `M_score` denotes the mean score, `SD_score` denotes the standard deviation of scores, `Max` and `Min` denote the maximum and minimum possible scores.

2.  **Personal Report of Public Speaking Anxiety (PRPSA):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** Quantifies an individual's level of anxiety specifically related to public speaking situations.
    *   **Mathematical Formula:** Typically a sum or average of responses to multiple Likert-type items. The paper does not provide the specific formula for aggregation, but notes that higher scores indicate more anxiety.
    *   **Symbol Explanation:** `T1` indicates measurement at Time 1 (recruitment); `T2` indicates measurement at Time 2 (after VR speech); $\alpha$ is `Cronbach's alpha`, a measure of internal consistency reliability; $M$ is the mean score; `SD` is the standard deviation.

3.  **Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (FNES):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** Measures an individual's dispositional apprehension about being judged negatively by others.
    *   **Mathematical Formula:** Typically a sum or average of responses to multiple Likert-type items. Higher scores indicate greater fear.
    *   **Symbol Explanation:** `T1`, `T2`, $\alpha$, $M$, `SD` have the same meaning as for `PRPSA`.

4.  **VR Experience Scale:**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** Assesses the extent of a participant's prior engagement with virtual reality technologies.
    *   **Mathematical Formula:** Typically an average of responses to multiple items. Higher scores indicate more experience.
    *   **Symbol Explanation:** $M$ is the mean score; `SD` is the standard deviation. In Study 2, $\alpha$ is also provided for internal consistency.

5.  **Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) Subscales:**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** Measures various facets of intrinsic motivation toward a task.
        *   `Interest/Enjoyment`: How engaging and pleasurable the task was.
        *   `Value/Usefulness`: How important and beneficial the participant perceived the task to be.
        *   `Effort/Importance`: How much effort the participant put in and how important they considered the task.
    *   **Mathematical Formula:** Each subscale is typically an average of its constituent Likert-type items.
    *   **Symbol Explanation:** $\alpha$ is Cronbach's alpha; $M$ is the mean score; `SD` is the standard deviation.

6.  **Spatial Presence Experience Scale (SPES):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** Measures the subjective feeling of being physically present within the virtual environment, indicating how realistic and immersive it felt.
    *   **Mathematical Formula:** An average of its constituent Likert-type items.
    *   **Symbol Explanation:** $\alpha$ is Cronbach's alpha; $M$ is the mean score; `SD` is the standard deviation.

7.  **State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** Measures current feelings of anxiety (state anxiety), focusing on sensations like calmness, tenseness, worry.
    *   **Mathematical Formula:** The paper states: "The scale is scored by taking the sum of all items (after reverse codes are corrected), multiplying by 20 and dividing by 6."
    *   **Symbol Explanation:** `T1`, `T2`, $\alpha$, $M$, `SD` have the usual meanings. `Reverse codes` refers to reversing the scoring for negatively phrased items so that higher numbers consistently reflect more of the measured construct (or less anxiety, in this case).

8.  **Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** Measures an individual's global self-worth and positive regard for oneself.
    *   **Mathematical Formula:** "The RSE is scored by taking the sum of the items (after reverse codes are corrected)."
    *   **Symbol Explanation:** `T1`, $\alpha$, $M$, `SD` have the usual meanings.

9.  **Self-Consciousness Scale—Revised (SCS-R):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** Measures an individual's tendency to focus attention on various aspects of the self, including public and private self-awareness.
    *   **Mathematical Formula:** "The scale was the mean of all items."
    *   **Symbol Explanation:** `T1`, $\alpha$, $M$, `SD` have the usual meanings.

10. **Personal Report of Confidence as a Speaker (MRPCS) - Somatic Scale:**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** Measures the physical symptoms of anxiety experienced during public speaking.
    *   **Mathematical Formula:** Typically an average of its constituent Likert-type items.
    *   **Symbol Explanation:** `T2`, $\alpha$, $M$, `SD` have the usual meanings.

11. **NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** A multi-dimensional assessment of perceived workload, including mental, physical, temporal demands, performance, effort, and frustration. In this study, it's used to assess perceived demand for speech delivery and rehearsal.
    *   **Mathematical Formula:** "The scale was averaged across 10 items."
    *   **Symbol Explanation:** $M$ is the mean score; `SD` is the standard deviation. `Dem.` likely refers to the delivery demand aspect, and `Reh.` refers to the rehearsal demand aspect.

12. **Cognitive Demand (adapted from Bowman et al., 2018):**
    *   **Conceptual Definition:** Specifically measures the mental effort and attention required for the task of practicing the speech in the lab.
    *   **Mathematical Formula:** "The scale is the average of seven items."
    *   **Symbol Explanation:** $\alpha$ is Cronbach's alpha; $M$ is the mean score; `SD` is the standard deviation.

## 5.3. Baselines

The paper's method (using `Virtual Reality` for public speaking practice) was compared against the following baselines:

*   **Study 1 Baselines:**
    *   **No Practice Condition:** Students who did *not* opt to practice their speech in `VR`. This serves as a control group to evaluate the general impact of `VR practice` versus no specialized practice.

*   **Study 2 Baselines:**
    *   **No Lab Practice Condition:** Students who did not attend any lab practice session (neither `VR`, `video`, nor `mirror`). This acts as the fundamental control group for evaluating the benefit of any structured lab practice.
    *   **Mirror Practice Condition:** Students who practiced their speech in front of a `5-foot easel mirror`. This is a traditional, low-tech method for self-feedback and self-awareness in public speaking.
    *   **Video-Recorded Practice Condition:** Students who practiced their speech while being `video-recorded`. They could see themselves on-screen during the presentation but were not required to review the recording afterward. This represents another common technological aid for self-assessment.

        These baselines are representative because they cover a spectrum of practice scenarios: no dedicated practice, traditional self-observation (`mirror`), common technological self-observation (`video`), and the novel `VR` simulation. This allows for a comprehensive understanding of where `VR` stands in comparison to existing, accessible methods.

# 6. Results & Analysis

## 6.1. Core Results Analysis

The paper presents results from two studies, each shedding light on different aspects of `VR training` for public speaking.

**Study 1 Analysis:**
Study 1 aimed to understand if `VR practice` is associated with higher `speech delivery grades` and whether it reduces `public speaking anxiety (PSA)` or `fear of negative evaluation (FNE)`.
*   **Preliminary Analysis:** Correlations between all variables were examined (Tables 2 and 3). No significant correlations were found between `age`, `gender`, and `speech grades`. However, `PSA` and `FNE` were strongly correlated $(r = .65, p < .001)$. $t$-tests confirmed no significant differences in initial `PRPSA`, `FNES`, or `VR experience` between participants who opted for `VR` and those who did not, which strengthens the subsequent comparisons despite the `quasi-experimental` design.

*   **Speech Grade Prediction:** A `hierarchical regression` (Table 5) was used to predict `final speech grades`.
    *   In Step 1 (`demographics`), `age` and `gender` had no significant effect.
    *   In Step 2 (`PRPSA`, `FNES`, `VR experience`), `PRPSA` emerged as a significant negative predictor, meaning students with higher `PSA` tended to have lower `speech grades` ($\beta = -.25$, $p = .02$).
    *   In Step 3 (`VR participation`), `practicing in VR` was a significant positive predictor of `final speech grades` ($\beta = .207$, $p = .02$). The overall model was significant (`F(6, 130) = 2.62, p = .02`). This suggests `VR practice` is associated with higher grades, controlling for initial anxiety and demographics.

*   **Anxiety and VR Experience:** No significant relationships were found between `speech anxiety`, `fear of negative evaluation`, and the `VR experience scales` (`spatial presence`, `intrinsic enjoyment`, `value`, `effort`), suggesting `VR practice` did not directly impact anxiety or FNE in this study.
*   **Program Feedback:** Only one `VR feedback` parameter, `time spent looking at the back-right quadrant`, significantly predicted `speech performance` ($\beta = -.95$, $p = .02$). This suggests the automated feedback provided by the `VR software` had limited direct impact on grades.

**Study 2 Analysis:**
Study 2 aimed to replicate the `lab-practice effect` from Study 1, rigorously comparing `VR practice` with `video-recorded` and `mirror practice` using `random assignment` to address `self-selection bias`. It also explored new potential mechanisms.
*   **Preliminary Analysis:** Similar to Study 1, `gender` and `age` were not correlated with `speech grades` (Table 6).

*   **Lab Practice Effect:** A `one-way ANOVA` comparing `speech grades` across `VR`, `mirror`, `video`, and `no lab practice` conditions was significant (`F(3, 367) = 2.96, p = .03, \eta^2 = .02`).
    *   `Post-hoc Bonferroni tests` revealed that all `lab practice` conditions (VR: $M=95.24$, $SD=16.91$; mirror: $M=95.39$, $SD=12.10$; video: $M=94.80$, $SD=13.63$) resulted in significantly higher `speech grades` than the `no lab practice` condition ($M=50.24$, $SD=6.43$).
    *   Crucially, there were **no significant pairwise differences** between the `VR`, `mirror`, and `video practice` conditions. This indicates that while any lab practice is beneficial, `VR` offered no *additional* advantage over simpler methods for improving grades.
*   **Potential Mediators:** `STAI-6`, `MRPCS`, and the `demand subscale of NASA-TLX` were significantly correlated with `speech grades` (Table 7).

*   **Perceived Demand of VR:** A `one-way MANOVA` examined differences in post-test measures (`STAI-6`, `MRPCS`, `satisfaction`, `NASA-TLX`, `IMI`) by `lab condition`.
    *   Significant differences were found for `NASA-TLX delivery scores` (`F(2, 177) = 7.75, p = .001, \eta^2 = .15`) and `NASA-TLX rehearsal scores` (`F(2, 78) = 4.29, p = .02, \eta^2 = .09`).
    *   Participants in the `VR condition` ($M=3.68, SD=0.94$) perceived `speech delivery` as more `demanding` than those in the `mirror` ($M=3.27, SD=1.03$) and `video` conditions ($M=2.94, SD=0.88$).
    *   `VR condition` ($M=3.52, SD=0.97$) also found `rehearsal` more `difficult` than the `video condition` ($M=2.91, SD=1.02$). This supports the `CASA paradigm` where `virtual others` simulate real-world demands.
    *   No other significant differences were observed across conditions for `anxiety`, `self-awareness`, `FNE`, or `sense of presence`.
*   **Predictors of Speech Grades (Lab Attendees):** A `hierarchical regression` (Table 8) among lab attendees found no significant predictors of `speech grades` among the measured variables (`age`, `gender`, `self-esteem`, `speech experience`, `PRPSA`, `STAI-T1`, `self-consciousness`, `FNES`, `VR experience`). This implies that, among students *already motivated enough to attend a lab practice session*, initial individual differences or prior `VR experience` did not strongly predict their `speech grades`.

## 6.3. Ablation Studies / Parameter Analysis

The paper does not feature traditional ablation studies where specific components of a model are removed to assess their individual contribution. However, Study 2 serves as a robust `comparative analysis` that functions similarly to an `ablation study` for the `VR` component itself. By comparing `VR practice` to `mirror practice` and `video-recorded practice`, the researchers effectively "ablate" the unique immersive and interactive features of `VR` to see if they offer additional benefits over simpler forms of self-observation.

*   **Comparison of Practice Modalities (Study 2):** The `ANOVA` results in Study 2 showed that while any `lab practice` improved `speech grades` compared to no practice, there were `no significant differences` between `VR`, `mirror`, and `video practice`. This is a critical finding: it implies that the immersive and feedback-rich environment of `VR` (its unique "components") did not provide superior results compared to the less technologically advanced `mirror` or `video` methods for the outcome of `speech grades` in a single session. This suggests that the *act of practicing and self-observing*, regardless of the specific medium, is the primary driver of improved grades, rather than the advanced features unique to `VR`.

*   **Analysis of VR Feedback (Study 1):** In Study 1, the researchers also examined the role of the `program's feedback variables` on `speech performance`. Only `time spent looking at the back-right quadrant` showed a significant, negative correlation with `speech grades`. This indicates that the automated `visual` and `vocal feedback` metrics provided by the `VirtualOrator` software were largely ineffective in directly predicting or influencing `speech grades` in a meaningful way. This can be interpreted as a form of `parameter analysis` or `component evaluation` of the `VR system`'s feedback mechanism. The discussion further highlights that students had `low compliance` in attending to feedback, and the `passively presented feedback` was of `limited use`, contrasting with findings by Chollet et al. (2015) who noted interactive feedback was engaging.

*   **Perceived Demand (Study 2):** While not an `ablation study` per se, the finding that `VR` was perceived as more `demanding` for both `delivery` and `rehearsal` compared to `mirror` and `video` conditions offers insight into a unique characteristic of the `VR environment`. This `parameter` (perceived demand) is a distinguishing feature of `VR` that supports its `realism` (as per the `CASA paradigm`), even if it didn't translate into superior grade outcomes in this study.

    These analyses suggest that while `VR` has certain unique attributes (immersive environment, automated metrics, higher perceived demand), these did not translate into a statistically significant advantage in `speech grade` improvement over simpler self-practice methods after a single session.

# 7. Conclusion & Reflections

## 7.1. Conclusion Summary
This paper presented the results of two studies evaluating the integration of a `virtual reality (VR)` public speaking training simulation into a `basic communication course`. The findings consistently demonstrated that `lab practice` of any kind (including `VR`, `mirror`, or `video-recorded sessions`) was associated with significantly higher `speech grades` compared to no practice. Specifically, Study 1 indicated a modest positive relationship between `VR practice` and final `speech scores`. However, a crucial finding from both studies was that `VR practice` did not significantly reduce `public speaking anxiety (PSA)` or `fear of negative evaluation (FNE)`. Moreover, Study 2 rigorously compared `VR` with `mirror` and `video practice` and found no significant differences in `speech grade` outcomes among these `lab-based practice conditions`. While `VR` was perceived as more `demanding` by participants, suggesting its effectiveness in simulating a realistic environment, this did not translate into superior performance or anxiety reduction compared to simpler alternatives. The studies conclude that `VR` can be a useful tool for motivating students to practice, but its unique benefits for `speech grade` improvement, especially from a single session, might be comparable to more accessible and cost-effective methods.

## 7.2. Limitations & Future Work
The authors acknowledged several limitations in their studies:

*   **Technical Difficulties with VR:** Students reported difficulties viewing `slides or notes` in the `VR classroom` due to issues like `small font size` or `wearing eyeglasses with the headset`. Technical glitches (e.g., `voices not captured`, `no scores received`) also hampered effectiveness.
*   **Low Compliance with Feedback:** Participants showed `low compliance` in attending to the `automated feedback` provided by the `VR software`. The `passively presented feedback` was of `limited use`, contrary to expectations for interactive feedback.
*   **Unequal Visual Representation in Comparison Conditions:** In Study 2, the `video condition` only showed participants from the `chest up`, while the `mirror condition` reflected the `full body`. This difference in visual scope could have impacted the comparability of the `self-observation` experience between these conditions.
*   **Confounds in Quasi-Experimental Design:** Study 1, being `quasi-experimental`, was susceptible to `selection effects`, where student motivation or underlying academic ability could have influenced both `lab attendance` and `speech scores`. Although Study 2 used `random assignment` to mitigate this, generalizability issues from studies situated within existing `classroom settings` remain.
*   **Single Practice Session:** The studies evaluated the effects of a single `VR practice session`. Longer-term exposure or repeated practice sessions might yield different results.
*   **Lack of Mechanism Identification:** While various potential mechanisms were measured, none were conclusively linked to subsequent `speech grades`, leaving the precise psychological pathways of improvement unclear.

    Based on these limitations, the authors suggest several directions for future research:

*   **Tailored and Interactive Feedback:** Future iterations should examine the role of `tailored feedback` delivered by a `trained public speaking instructor`, or offer opportunities to `examine automated feedback scores with a third party` capable of interpreting it.
*   **Standardized Comparison Conditions:** Ensure that `video` and `mirror conditions` capture the `same amount of a participant's body` for better control and to parse out the specific effects of different self-observation methods.
*   **Longitudinal Studies:** Investigate the effects of `repeated VR practice sessions` over time to see if cumulative exposure leads to superior outcomes or anxiety reduction.
*   **Exploring Motivational Aspects:** Further research into how the `novelty` and `enjoyment` of `VR` can be leveraged to `entice students to practice`, given that practice is a key factor in improving performance.
*   **Improved VR Software and Hardware:** Address technical limitations related to `note visibility` and `feedback mechanisms` in `VR platforms`.

## 7.3. Personal Insights & Critique
This paper provides a pragmatic and much-needed empirical evaluation of `VR` in a real-world educational context. Its strength lies in directly comparing `VR` to conventional and accessible `lab practice` methods (`mirror`, `video`) and focusing on `speech grades`, a highly relevant outcome for educators. The inclusion of two studies, with the second addressing the `selection bias` of the first through `random assignment`, significantly strengthens the validity of its conclusions.

**Inspirations & Applications:**
*   **Emphasis on Practice:** The core takeaway that *any* structured practice is better than none is a powerful reinforcement for public speaking pedagogy. `VR`, even if not uniquely superior, can serve as an engaging `gateway` to encourage practice.
*   **Motivational Tool:** The finding that students found `VR sessions` enjoyable and valuable highlights `VR`'s potential as a `motivational tool`. In large courses, where student engagement can be a challenge, the `novelty` of `VR` could be a significant asset in encouraging participation in practice sessions.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness Considerations:** The equivalence of `VR` to `mirror` and `video practice` in terms of grade improvement offers practical insights for resource-constrained institutions. If the goal is solely to improve `speech grades` in a single session, cheaper and more accessible technologies might suffice.
*   **CASA Paradigm Validation:** The increased perceived `demand` in `VR` supports the `Computers as Social Actors` paradigm, suggesting that `virtual audiences` do evoke realistic psychological responses. This opens avenues for future research into how to harness this `realism` for more targeted training.

**Potential Issues & Areas for Improvement:**
*   **Limited Mechanism Exploration:** While the paper measured many potential mediators, it didn't conclusively identify *why* `VR` (or other practice) leads to better grades, or why `PSA/FNE` wasn't reduced. Future work could benefit from process-oriented measures during the practice itself (e.g., physiological arousal during different conditions) or more detailed qualitative data on how students engaged with `VR feedback`.
*   **Single-Session Limitation:** The focus on a `single practice session` might underestimate `VR`'s potential. `VR` could offer cumulative benefits over multiple sessions, particularly for gradual `anxiety desensitization` or habituating to diverse virtual audiences.
*   **Feedback Design:** The `VR system's` passive feedback was found to be largely ineffective. This is a crucial design challenge for `VR pedagogical tools`. Future systems should focus on `just-in-time`, `adaptive`, and `actionable feedback` that students are compelled to engage with and understand.
*   **Generalizability:** While Study 2 improved upon Study 1's design, the specific context (a single introductory course at one university) might limit generalizability. Replication in diverse educational settings and with different `VR systems` would be valuable.
*   **"No Lab" Baseline Interpretation:** The significant difference between `lab practice` and `no lab practice` is very large ($M=95$ vs. $M=50$ for grades in Study 2). While indicative of the value of practice, the `no lab` group's mean score seems unusually low, which might overstate the `effect size` of *any* intervention. Further contextualization of this specific grading outcome for the `no lab` group could be beneficial.

    Overall, this paper serves as a valuable empirical contribution, moving beyond speculative claims about `VR`'s potential to provide concrete evidence of its utility and limitations in a practical educational setting. It rightly encourages further research to refine `VR`'s integration and optimize its unique features for public speaking pedagogy.
